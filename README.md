## Steps To Follow
- Select an issue and ask to be _assigned_ to it.
- Check existing scripts in the [projects](/projects/) directory.
- **Star** this repository.
- On the [Usefull-scripts](https://github.com/TS-Morocco/Python-Small-Projects) repo page, click the **Fork** button.

- **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine. This button will show you the URL to run.
    <br><img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/code-button.png" title="Code button" width="400"/>

    For example, run this command inside your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Usefull-scripts.git
    ```

    **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

    Learn more about [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid merge conflicts:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/TS-Morocco/Python-Small-Projects.git
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream master
    git push
    ```
    
    Alternatively, GitHub also provides syncing now - click "Fetch upstream" at the top of your repo below "Code" button.

- If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can try this one by [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/git-merge-conflict).

- Checkout to development branch (*name your branch according to the issue name*).

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

- Create a folder in
  [projects directory](https://github.com/TS-Morocco/Python-Small-Projects/tree/master/projects)
  according to issue name.
- Write your code and add to the respective folder in the projects directory, locally.
- Don't forget to add a `README.md` in your folder, according to the
   [README_TEMPLATE.](https://github.com/TS-Morocco/Python-Small-Projects/blob/master/README_TEMPLATE.md)
- Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` ([write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), if possible):

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "<your message>"
    ```

- Push the code _to your repository_.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

- Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and **make a pull request**:

    ![pull request image](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/choose-base-and-compare-branches.png)

    Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
- Now wait, until one of us *reviews your Pull Request*! If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.
